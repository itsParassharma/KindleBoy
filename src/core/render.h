/*
 * render.h — blow the little 160x144 Game Boy picture up to fit the screen,
 * turning its 4 gray shades into something the e-ink panel can show.
 *
 * Two ways to do it:
 *
 *   FAST (the default): dither down to pure black and white with a 2x2 Bayer
 *     pattern, because the fast "A2" refresh can only do 1-bit anyway. The key
 *     detail is that the dither pattern is tied to where a pixel sits on screen,
 *     not to the frame — so anything that isn't moving comes out byte-for-byte
 *     identical every time, which keeps it from shimmering or ghosting. The two
 *     middle grays are dithered at 1/4 and 3/4 black (not the obvious 1/3 and
 *     2/3) to pull them as far apart as possible; at A2 speed that legibility
 *     matters more than being tonally correct.
 *
 *   QUALITY: skip the dither and use 4 real grays {0xFF,0xAA,0x55,0x00} with the
 *     slower, non-flashing GL16 refresh. This is what a still screen gets
 *     promoted to, and what the QUALITY toggle uses throughout.
